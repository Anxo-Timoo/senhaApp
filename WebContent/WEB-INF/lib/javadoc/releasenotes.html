<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoRepository</code> instances in roundtrip optimization mode</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A <code>JCoRepository</code> operating in the default roundtrip optimization mode reported that a function module would not
exist in the connected ABAP back-end system and returned <code>null</code> from its function module related getter-methods,
if the function module to be queried was not RFC-enabled. This might have resulted in failing RFC outbound scenarios where
some ABAP function module, which would be called locally by default, is redirected via a remote function call to a
<code>JCoServer</code> program TCP/IP destination for processing the respective request externally at Java side.

<tr><td>
When a <code>JCoServer</code> should be stopped and while it was stopping a request was partially received from a client, the server
got into a hanging state and so did the RFC client connection at the partner side. This was due to an illegal state in the
CPIC layer caused by the JCo Server logic, which has been adjusted to avoid the illegal situation.

The bugfix provided in JCo 3.1.4, when a <code>JCoServer</code> application was running in an environment with network issues,
was unfortunately not sufficient, so that still an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> could occur. It required additional

<tr><td>
When using <code>jco.client.serialization_format=columnBased</code> with parameters containing nested structures with nested tables, the communication
failed with various errors at backend side in the deserializer of the fast serialization. This was due to a wrong implementation of serializing
such types of parameters.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement for load balancing destinations</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When using load balancing configured destinations (by specifying the <code>jco.client.mshost</code> and its accompanying properties), JCo 3.1 is offering
support for soft shutdown of application servers by regularly checking whether a concrete instance still is part of the logon group. This
feature works nicely only, if the logon group is flagged to be external RFC-enabled, otherwise membership is not known at JCo side.
As a consequence, JCo was communicating more often with the message server, which was introducing a performance penalty in particular when
communicating with older message servers in networks with high latency, as this failure situation was not cached.<br/>
<em>Note:</em> When using natting IPs in the logon group, the Ext. RFC-enabled flag cannot be set as those IPs can be used only without this flag.

RFC client calls using the tRfc, qRfc or bgRfc protocol were not implemented thread-safe with regard to therein used TIDs,
queue names and unit IDs. When invoking remote function modules (RFMs) via the t/q/bgRfc protocol to the same
<code>JCoDestination</code> in multiple threads simultaneously, used TIDs, queue names and unit IDs could have been
overwritten and used in the wrong thread context, which might have led to lost data in the target system.<br/>
For example, IDocs that seemed to have been transferred correctly without an error, were not stored in the target system,
because the TID contract was broken and several IDocs were erroneously sent at the same time with the same TID
although different ones had been specified.<br/>

When a <code>JCoServer</code> application was running in an environment with network issues, JCo recognized the erroneous
situation incorrectly, so that the connection was not closed in the underlying CPIC layer leading to internal events
that were not properly handled and caused a memory leak. As a consequence, an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>
occurred and in the JCo trace numerous entries similar to the following one were written within a few milliseconds always

After the invocation of a function module, the client side application was idle for a while, and thus the server. Therefore,
the WebSocket client triggered ping messages to keep the connection alive. Due to the recursion based internal design of the
<code>JCoServer</code>'s WebSocket ping handler, a large call stack could be built up. If it takes long enough, a
<code>StackoverFlowError</code> occurred at JCo side with repeated invocations of
<code>com.sap.conn.rfc.driver.WebSocketServerDriver.internalRead(WebSocketServerDriver.java:289)</code> and

but remained in <code>JCoServerState.STOPPING</code>. This happened after the invocation of a function module and after the client side
application was idle for a while, and thus also the <code>JCoServer</code>. After processing a WebSocket ping, the server connection got
into a wrong state so that it could not be closed, but this would be required after requesting to stop the <code>JCoServer</code> instance

When the new reentrance ticket technology introduced as of S/4HANA 1909 was used to logon to the communication partner system,
and the <code>JCoCustomRepository</code> was configured to use query mode <code>DISABLE_REPOSITORY_POOL</code>, querying RFC meta data
resulted in a logon failure complaining that the used logon ticket was invalid. Unfortunately, there was an implementation error in
conjunction with query mode <code>DISABLE_REPOSITORY_POOL</code> which resulted in the handed over reentrance ticket being used twice
so that the RFC logon failed the second time, because reentrance tickets are one-time tickets which can be used only once.

JCo 3.1 is the successor of JCo 3.0. In note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2786882">2786882</a>
you can find the JVMs and platforms on which the new version is supported. Please note that some platforms have been
dropped and that the minimum JVM version has been raised to Java 8. JCo 3.1 is supposed to be byte-code compatible to
JCo 3.0 as long as you are not using methods or fields, that have been deprecated in JCo 3.0. Those have been removed
from JCo 3.1. Below you can find a set of the most important new features now supported with JCo 3.1.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for fast serialization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The RFC runtime of JCo can now serialize the function module data in the fast serialization mode, if the partner system
supports that serialization format as well. Technically, it is a column-based serialization of the data, which has been
shipped initially with application server ABAP 7.51 and has been downported later so that also older systems benefit
from the performance improvements of that serialization. Note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2372888">2372888</a>

RFC communication is possible also using WebSocket technology instead of the existing CPIC based one. The WebSocket RFC
communication feature was initially shipped with ABAP Platform 1909 (application server ABAP 7.54). So far, only client
side communication is supported, i.e. JCo calling an ABAP system. The ABAP platform

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Configuring a high availability registered server</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The registration at a system instead of a single gateway allows to have high availability support for a
<code>JCoServer</code>. Thus, instead of registering only at one specific gateway, a server program can register at all
gateways belonging to a given system identified by the message server (with the possibility to limit the set of
application servers to a logon group). If one application server is shutdown or restarted (e.g. when doing a rolling
kernel update) the <code>JCoServer</code> can still be reached via the remaining gateways.<br/>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Change events for SessionReferenceProvider</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Just like the DataProviders, also the <code>SessionReferenceProvider</code> allows to support events. Thus, connections
and sessions within the JCo runtime are cleaned up immediately whenever a session is terminated. Note that
<code>isSessionAlive()</code> will still be invoked from time to time in order to find zombie sessions that were
not cleaned up properly by session management.<br/>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Record conversion to and from JSON</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
All <code>JCoRecords</code> are offering the possibility to efficiently convert their data to a natural JSON representation
(<code>JCoTable</code> is represented as an array, <code>JCoStructures</code> as a JavaScript structure and each field
has the (uppercase) name like in ABAP). Furthermore, it is possible to fill <code>JCoRecords</code> from such documents
with data. Thus it is easily possible to offer simple and short JCo code that interacts with a JavaScript based user interface.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Multitenancy with JCo</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
By default, JCo 3.1 is still running in a single tenant mode. However, the JCo runtime has been extended to support
multi-tenant environments. By implementing and registering a <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.TenantProvider</code>, it is
possible to isolate <code>JCoDestinations</code> (and, certainly, the associated connections), <code>JCoRepositorys</code>,
and other important runtime artifacts for different tenants.

The following new ABAP type is now supported by JCo: <code>UTCLONG</code>.<br/>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for configuring a load balancing destination with sticky behavior</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Some JCo applications need to make sure that once a communication started with an application server, the same application
server is used for all requests afterwards, even if the executed requests are stateless. This allows efficient usage of
cached data and database buffers on application server side. Hence, JCo introduces the destination configuration parameter
<code>jco.client.sticky</code>, which specifies whether the pool should get sticky to the application server. After an
idle time period, during which the application does not execute any requests, a different application server could be used
for further requests, depending on the current load determined by the message server.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>MessageServer info</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The package <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ms</code> allows to interact with a message server and to get information about the
application servers and groups in that system. The <code>JCoMessageServerFactory</code> fetches the necessary physical
information for the message server from the registered <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.MessageServerDataProvider</code> that
is fitting to the given logical message server.<br/>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>CPIC performance improvement in WAN scenarios</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When executing requests in WAN scenarios and exchanging large data amounts, the streaming feature of CPIC allows to send
data without waiting for acknowledgements for each data package. Thus, latency effects and overall execution times are
dramatically decreased. JCo turns on CPIC streaming automatically, if the partner system supports it as well.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Adjustable socket buffer size</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo allows to set the low-level socket buffer size via JCo property <code>jco.ni.socket_buffer_size</code>, which allows
to tune network performance.<br/>

<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2047230">2047230</a> and

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>JCo repository roundtrip optmization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With JCo 3.1, the default for JCo property <code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> changed to 1, which
means that if the backend supports it, the network roundtrip optimized function module <code>RFC_METADATA_GET</code>
is used for better performance when looking up metadata.<br/>
As a consequence you might need to adopt the authorization profile for your repository user ID as described in SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/460089">460089</a> if you were not using this
feature yet.
